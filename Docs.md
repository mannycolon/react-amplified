## Amplify

### AWS AppSync (a managed GraphQL service)

### Commands

- Install and configure the Amplify CLI

```bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

```bash
amplify configure
```

```bash
```

- Initialize a new Amplify backend

```bash
amplify init
```

- Add a GraphQL API to your app and automatically provision a database by running the the following command from the root of your application directory:

```bash
amplify add api
```

- To deploy this backend, run the push command:

```bash
amplify push
```

- Run the following command to check Amplifyâ€™s status:

```bash
amplify status
```

- To view the GraphQL API in the AppSync console at any time, run the following command:

```bash
amplify console api
```

- To view your entire app in the Amplify console at any time, run the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

- Test your API

```bash
amplify mock api
```

> This will open the GraphiQL explorer on a local port. From the test environment you can try out different operations locally, like queries and mutations.

- Create authentication service

```bash
amplify add auth
```

> ? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
>
> ? How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
>
> ? Do you want to configure advanced settings? No, I am done.

To deploy the service, run the push command:

```bash
amplify push
```

Now, the authentication service has been deployed and you can start using it. To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to Amplify Console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

- Create login UI

1. Import the withAuthenticator component:

```js
import { withAuthenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'
```

1. Change the default export to be the withAuthenticator wrapping the main component:

```js
export default withAuthenticator(App)
```

1. Run the app to see the new Authentication flow protecting the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Now you should see the app load with an authentication flow allowing users to sign up and sign in.

In this example, you used the Amplify React UI library and the withAuthenticator component to quickly get up and running with a real-world authentication flow.

You can also customize this component to add or remove fields, update styling, or other configurations.

In addition to the withAuthenticator you can build custom authentication flows using the Auth class.

Auth has over 30 methods including signUp, signIn, forgotPasword, and signOut that allow you full control over all aspects of the user authentication flow. Check out the complete API [here](https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/api/classes/authclass.html)

- Add hosting to your app

From the root of your project, run the following command and select the bolded options.

```bash
amplify add hosting
```

> ? Select the plugin module to execute: # Hosting with Amplify Console (Managed hosting with custom domains, Continuous deployment)
> ? Choose a type: # Manual Deployment

- Publish your app

```bash
amplify publish
```
