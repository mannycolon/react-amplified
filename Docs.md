## Amplify

### AWS AppSync (a managed GraphQL service)

### Commands

- Install and configure the Amplify CLI

```bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

```bash
amplify configure
```

```bash
```

- Initialize a new Amplify backend

```bash
amplify init
```

- Add a GraphQL API to your app and automatically provision a database by running the the following command from the root of your application directory:

```bash
amplify add api
```

- To deploy this backend, run the push command:

```bash
amplify push
```

- Run the following command to check Amplifyâ€™s status:

```bash
amplify status
```

- To view the GraphQL API in the AppSync console at any time, run the following command:

```bash
amplify console api
```

- To view your entire app in the Amplify console at any time, run the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

- Test your API

```bash
amplify mock api
```

> This will open the GraphiQL explorer on a local port. From the test environment you can try out different operations locally, like queries and mutations.

- Create authentication service

```bash
amplify add auth
```

> ? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
>
> ? How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
>
> ? Do you want to configure advanced settings? No, I am done.

To deploy the service, run the push command:

```bash
amplify push
```

Now, the authentication service has been deployed and you can start using it. To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to Amplify Console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```
